[B]Note:[/B] Questlines will sometimes have multiple quests with the same name. [I]That is NOT a bug!![/I] The game filters quests in background processes I don't have access to (or at least I haven't figured out how, yet), depending eg. on the player's class, race, faction group, etc. There are also quests which are obsolete but haven't been removed from the game, yet.  
Currently, those quests need to be filtered manually. You're welcome to report those, especially if you know how to distinguish them.  
[I]Also note, those name doublets are merely a visual nuisance. Don't let them irritate you. The game will still choose the correct quest for you as soon as you reach that point in a questline.[/I]

⚠️[B]Translators:[/B] [I]Please do [B]not[/B] provide any localizations, yet. All strings are still hard coded and many of them are often subject to change in the current state of development (beta).[/I]
[I]Note: Future changes and instruction details will be provided in this sections.[/I]
